# Project Proposal

### Problem: What factors, such as health conditions or resource accesibility, affect life expectancy? 

#### Data Set: https://www.kaggle.com/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who?select=Life+Expectancy+Data.csv 
This data presents yearly healthcare information from various countries. The rows of the dataset contain information like prevalence rates of various health conditions, immunization coverages, and average life expectancy. We can use this data to develop a model that predicts average life expectancy of an individual based on what country they are in and the expected health conditions in that country. 

Predicting life expectancy can help to determine which factors have greater or lesser influences on health. Ultimately, this allows us to better understand where efforts should be focused towards in order to most effectively combat disparities in healthcare outcomes for global populations. Our dataset allows us to take a high-level view of the problem and eventually highlight the outlying countries or features that should be studied further.
